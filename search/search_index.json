It runs over the existing networks and provides the means to stretch the L2 network. Only VMs within the same VXLAN segment can communicate with each other. Each VXLAN segment is identified by a 24 bit segment ID called \u201cVXLAN Network Identifier (VNI)\u201d.  This help overcome 4094 VLAN scale limitation and able to extend it to 224 segments.\n\n\nVXLAN uses BGP as its control plane for Overlay. It makes it forwarding decisions at VTEPs (Virtual tunnel end points) for layer-2 and layer-3. Forwarding happens based on MAC or IP learnt via control plane (MP-BGP EVPN) .

The scripts in Ansible are called playbooks; playbook is in YAML format that was desgiened to be easy for humans to read and write. Playbooks include one or more plays, each play include one or more tasks. Each task is associated with one module, which is what gets executed in the playbook. Modules are python scripts that ship with Ansible installation.
